Background

Each page displays a contact email address based on the value selected from a dropdown list, in the custom metadata (dynamic-metadata[name="contact"])
A velocity macro, included from the velocity format attached to the DEFAULT region, uses the value from the dropdown list to 

#import("/_cascade/formats/contact-modified")

#macro (outputContact $page)
       #set($contact = $_XPathTool.selectSingleNode($page, "dynamic-metadata[name='contact']/value").value)
       #set($block = $_.locateBlock("/_cascade/blocks/contacts/${contact}"))

       #if(!$block.empty)
        <p>For more information contact: 
            $block.xML
        </p>
       #end
    
    ##if($page.getChild("last-modified").value)
       ## #set($lastMod = $_DateTool.getDate($page.getChild("last-modified").value))
        ##<p class="small right">Last updated: $_DateTool.format("MM/dd/yyyy", $lastMod)</small></p>   
    ##end
#end

Because the blocks are included dynamically, I can't use the Relationships feature to tell which contact information XML Blocks are not being used.
And because there are over 30 different metadata sets, they could have different options to choose from in the dropdown list.
Lastly, the XML Blocks use javascript to generate the emailto: links (which could pose a problem if javascript disabled.
It would be better to generate the HTML from a data definition block paired with a velocity format, possibly leveraging inline editing.

The following scripts have been written to help manage the drop down lists.

- TDI - Training:/reports/contact/contact-count-mdSets.vm
Uses the query tool to check how many pages have selected a particular value from a dropdown list defined in a MetaData Set.
Requires manually defining the name of each metadata set in a given Site.

- TDI - Training:/reports/contact/iist-contacts.vm
  A format that takes a Metadata Set and loops through each dropdown option definied in it.
  Requires manually defining an array with every value in the dropdown list for the MetaData Set in question.

QUESTIONS
How can I get automatically check all the values for the same dropdown list in all the Metadata Sets in all the Sites?
