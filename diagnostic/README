to identify Broken Links, External Links and Orphaned Files in all your web documents. Before you publish your website on the internet, it's a great practice to make sure all of your links work and that your site doesn't contain any unnecessary files. Fortunately, Dreamweaver can help you with that. Dreamweaver's Link Checker tool helps you identify your broken links, external links and any orphaned files within your current document.

You can also use it to check multiple selected files or to check an entire local managed site with a single command. Checking links is really important because it helps ensure that all of your internal and external links are functional. Similarly, finding orphans should be an important site cleanup step in your workflow because it helps identify files that aren't being used. You can then remove those orphaned files from your managed site thereby ensuring that you won't be unintentionally uploading files to your host server that aren't relevant to your site's functionality.
